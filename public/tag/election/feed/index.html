										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-drop-cap" id="has-drop-cap">Space scientists have discovered just how much they can accomplish when they work together, with incredible feats achieved this year through collaborations with commercial industry and foreign nations.</p>



<p>Successful partnerships in 2022 have included the launch and calibration of the most powerful space telescope in the world and photographing the never-before-seen supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way galaxy.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-text-align-center"><p>Space, it says, is big. Really big. You just won&#8217;t believe how vastly, hugely, mindbogglingly big it is.</p><cite>Douglas Adams</cite></blockquote>



<p>Stray rocket junk in an unpredictable orbit smashed into the moon, for example, creating a new crater. And NASA&#8217;s mega moon rocket, the Space Launch System, has stumbled on its way to its first lunar mission, with the agency encountering several problems with contractors&#8217; work during a critical test this spring.</p>



<p>Whether the rest of the year will include the inaugural moon-bound Artemis mission, the United States&#8217; return to human deep space exploration, remains to be seen. Read more about the year&#8217;s biggest moments in space, so far.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>James Webb Space Telescope opens for business</strong></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://demo.akbilisim.com/newsy/hotnews/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2022/10/img-1.jpeg" alt="fully unfurled and calibrated James Webb Space Telescope"/><figcaption>The James Webb Space Telescope will deliver its first full-color images on July 12.&nbsp;Credit: NASA</figcaption></figure>



<p>The most powerful observatory in space hit its mark at a destination 1 million miles from Earth in late January and unfurled its complicated,&nbsp;<a href="#">tennis court-size sun shield</a>. Engineers have since calibrated the Webb telescope&#8217;s scientific instruments,&nbsp;<a href="#">exceeding expectations</a>&nbsp;for its level of precision.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote alignleft has-text-align-left"><blockquote><p>In this single galaxy of ours there are eighty-seven thousand million suns.</p><cite>Arthur C. Clarke</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Astronomers anticipate the telescope will stoke a golden age in our understanding of the cosmos, providing snapshots of space&nbsp;<a href="#">billions of light-years away</a>.</p>



<p>On July 12, the James Webb Space Telescope, a partnership between NASA, the European Space Agency, and the Canadian Space Agency, will deliver its&nbsp;<a href="#">first full-color images</a>. What those first cosmic targets will be is a closely guarded secret.</p>



<p>Webb is expected to observe some of the oldest, faintest light in the universe. The telescope will focus on a period less than 300 million years after the Big Bang, when many of the first stars and galaxies were born.</p>



<p>Scientists will also use the telescope to peer into the atmospheres of planets outside our solar system, called&nbsp;<a href="#">exoplanets</a>. Discoveries out there of water and methane, for example, could be signs of potential habitability or biological activity.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Peculiar widespread Martian aurora discovered</strong></h3>



<p>New overview images of Mars have revealed a stunning green light show in the planet&#8217;s sky.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright is-resized"><img fetchPriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://demo.akbilisim.com/newsy/hotnews/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2022/10/img-2.jpeg" alt="green wormlike aurora streaking Martian sky" width="429" height="241"/><figcaption>Scientists believe a newly discovered Martian aurora puts green streaks in Mars&#8217; sky.&nbsp;Credit: Emirates Mars Mission</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Much of Mars&#8217; atmosphere apparently has a wormlike streak, an aurora similar to the Northern Lights sometimes visible on Earth. The Martian aurora is a glowing, twisted band of ultraviolet light, stretching thousands of miles from the dayside, which faces the sun, to the back of the planet.</p>



<p>A United Arab Emirates Space Agency probe orbiting Mars, known as Hope,&nbsp;<a href="#">took the snapshots</a>.</p>



<p>No one knows how it&#8217;s happening, given that scientists believe&nbsp;<a href="https://mgs-mager.gsfc.nasa.gov/kids/magfield.html">Mars&#8217; magnetic field</a>&nbsp;largely deteriorated billions of years ago. Magnetic fields guide high-energy streams of electrons from the sun into a planet&#8217;s atmosphere.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Astronomers take the first photo of massive Milky Way black hole</strong></h3>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignleft is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://demo.akbilisim.com/newsy/hotnews/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2022/10/img-3.jpeg" alt="Sagittarius A* black hole" width="312" height="312"/><figcaption>Scientists around the world worked together to take the first photo ever of Sagittarius A*, the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way galaxy.&nbsp;Credit: Event Horizon Telescope</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>At the center of the Milky Way is a giant black hole, and for the first time ever,&nbsp;<a href="#">astronomers were able to see it</a>.</p>



<p>Black holes don&#8217;t have surfaces, like planets or stars. Instead, these mysterious cosmic objects have a boundary called an &#8220;event horizon,&#8221; a point of no return. If anything swoops too close to that point, it will fall inward, never to escape the hole&#8217;s gravity.</p>



<p>With the power of eight linked radio dishes from around the world, the&nbsp;<a href="#">Event Horizon Telescope took a picture</a>&nbsp;of the shadow of the supermassive black hole known as Sagittarius A*. Hundreds of scientists from 80 institutions around the globe worked together to collect, process, and piece together fragments of data to make the picture.</p>



<p>Up until three years ago, any depiction of a black hole was merely an artist&#8217;s interpretation or a computer model. Now scientists have a snapshot of the real deal, which spans 27 million miles.</p>



<p>With financial support from the National Science Foundation and other groups, scientists plan to enhance their technology to make the image drastically sharper.</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap" id="has-drop-cap">Space scientists have discovered just how much they can accomplish when they work together, with incredible feats achieved this year through collaborations with commercial industry and foreign nations.</p>



<p>Successful partnerships in 2022 have included the launch and calibration of the most powerful space telescope in the world and photographing the never-before-seen supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way galaxy.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-text-align-center"><p>Space, it says, is big. Really big. You just won&#8217;t believe how vastly, hugely, mindbogglingly big it is.</p><cite>Douglas Adams</cite></blockquote>



<p>Stray rocket junk in an unpredictable orbit smashed into the moon, for example, creating a new crater. And NASA&#8217;s mega moon rocket, the Space Launch System, has stumbled on its way to its first lunar mission, with the agency encountering several problems with contractors&#8217; work during a critical test this spring.</p>



<p>Whether the rest of the year will include the inaugural moon-bound Artemis mission, the United States&#8217; return to human deep space exploration, remains to be seen. Read more about the year&#8217;s biggest moments in space, so far.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>James Webb Space Telescope opens for business</strong></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://demo.akbilisim.com/newsy/hotnews/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2022/10/img-1.jpeg" alt="fully unfurled and calibrated James Webb Space Telescope"/><figcaption>The James Webb Space Telescope will deliver its first full-color images on July 12.&nbsp;Credit: NASA</figcaption></figure>



<p>The most powerful observatory in space hit its mark at a destination 1 million miles from Earth in late January and unfurled its complicated,&nbsp;<a href="#">tennis court-size sun shield</a>. Engineers have since calibrated the Webb telescope&#8217;s scientific instruments,&nbsp;<a href="#">exceeding expectations</a>&nbsp;for its level of precision.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote alignleft has-text-align-left"><blockquote><p>In this single galaxy of ours there are eighty-seven thousand million suns.</p><cite>Arthur C. Clarke</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Astronomers anticipate the telescope will stoke a golden age in our understanding of the cosmos, providing snapshots of space&nbsp;<a href="#">billions of light-years away</a>.</p>



<p>On July 12, the James Webb Space Telescope, a partnership between NASA, the European Space Agency, and the Canadian Space Agency, will deliver its&nbsp;<a href="#">first full-color images</a>. What those first cosmic targets will be is a closely guarded secret.</p>



<p>Webb is expected to observe some of the oldest, faintest light in the universe. The telescope will focus on a period less than 300 million years after the Big Bang, when many of the first stars and galaxies were born.</p>



<p>Scientists will also use the telescope to peer into the atmospheres of planets outside our solar system, called&nbsp;<a href="#">exoplanets</a>. Discoveries out there of water and methane, for example, could be signs of potential habitability or biological activity.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Peculiar widespread Martian aurora discovered</strong></h3>



<p>New overview images of Mars have revealed a stunning green light show in the planet&#8217;s sky.</p>

<figure class="alignright is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://demo.akbilisim.com/newsy/hotnews/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2022/10/img-2.jpeg" alt="green wormlike aurora streaking Martian sky" width="429" height="241"/><figcaption>Scientists believe a newly discovered Martian aurora puts green streaks in Mars&#8217; sky.&nbsp;Credit: Emirates Mars Mission</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Much of Mars&#8217; atmosphere apparently has a wormlike streak, an aurora similar to the Northern Lights sometimes visible on Earth. The Martian aurora is a glowing, twisted band of ultraviolet light, stretching thousands of miles from the dayside, which faces the sun, to the back of the planet.</p>



<p>A United Arab Emirates Space Agency probe orbiting Mars, known as Hope,&nbsp;<a href="#">took the snapshots</a>.</p>



<p>No one knows how it&#8217;s happening, given that scientists believe&nbsp;<a href="https://mgs-mager.gsfc.nasa.gov/kids/magfield.html">Mars&#8217; magnetic field</a>&nbsp;largely deteriorated billions of years ago. Magnetic fields guide high-energy streams of electrons from the sun into a planet&#8217;s atmosphere.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Astronomers take the first photo of massive Milky Way black hole</strong></h3>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>At the center of the Milky Way is a giant black hole, and for the first time ever,&nbsp;<a href="#">astronomers were able to see it</a>.</p>



<p>Black holes don&#8217;t have surfaces, like planets or stars. Instead, these mysterious cosmic objects have a boundary called an &#8220;event horizon,&#8221; a point of no return. If anything swoops too close to that point, it will fall inward, never to escape the hole&#8217;s gravity.</p>



<p>With the power of eight linked radio dishes from around the world, the&nbsp;<a href="#">Event Horizon Telescope took a picture</a>&nbsp;of the shadow of the supermassive black hole known as Sagittarius A*. Hundreds of scientists from 80 institutions around the globe worked together to collect, process, and piece together fragments of data to make the picture.</p>



<p>Up until three years ago, any depiction of a black hole was merely an artist&#8217;s interpretation or a computer model. Now scientists have a snapshot of the real deal, which spans 27 million miles.</p>



<p>With financial support from the National Science Foundation and other groups, scientists plan to enhance their technology to make the image drastically sharper.</p>

<p>Successful partnerships in 2022 have included the launch and calibration of the most powerful space telescope in the world and photographing the never-before-seen supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way galaxy.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>James Webb Space Telescope opens for business</strong></h3>

<p>The most powerful observatory in space hit its mark at a destination 1 million miles from Earth in late January and unfurled its complicated,&nbsp;<a href="#">tennis court-size sun shield</a>. Engineers have since calibrated the Webb telescope&#8217;s scientific instruments,&nbsp;<a href="#">exceeding expectations</a>&nbsp;for its level of precision.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote alignleft has-text-align-left"><blockquote><p>In this single galaxy of ours there are eighty-seven thousand million suns.</p><cite>Arthur C. Clarke</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Astronomers anticipate the telescope will stoke a golden age in our understanding of the cosmos, providing snapshots of space&nbsp;<a href="#">billions of light-years away</a>.</p>



<p>On July 12, the James Webb Space Telescope, a partnership between NASA, the European Space Agency, and the Canadian Space Agency, will deliver its&nbsp;<a href="#">first full-color images</a>. What those first cosmic targets will be is a closely guarded secret.</p>



<p>Webb is expected to observe some of the oldest, faintest light in the universe. The telescope will focus on a period less than 300 million years after the Big Bang, when many of the first stars and galaxies were born.</p>



<p>Scientists will also use the telescope to peer into the atmospheres of planets outside our solar system, called&nbsp;<a href="#">exoplanets</a>. Discoveries out there of water and methane, for example, could be signs of potential habitability or biological activity.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Peculiar widespread Martian aurora discovered</strong></h3>



<p>New overview images of Mars have revealed a stunning green light show in the planet&#8217;s sky.</p>

<p>Much of Mars&#8217; atmosphere apparently has a wormlike streak, an aurora similar to the Northern Lights sometimes visible on Earth. The Martian aurora is a glowing, twisted band of ultraviolet light, stretching thousands of miles from the dayside, which faces the sun, to the back of the planet.</p>



<p>A United Arab Emirates Space Agency probe orbiting Mars, known as Hope,&nbsp;<a href="#">took the snapshots</a>.</p>



<p>No one knows how it&#8217;s happening, given that scientists believe&nbsp;<a href="https://mgs-mager.gsfc.nasa.gov/kids/magfield.html">Mars&#8217; magnetic field</a>&nbsp;largely deteriorated billions of years ago. Magnetic fields guide high-energy streams of electrons from the sun into a planet&#8217;s atmosphere.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Astronomers take the first photo of massive Milky Way black hole</strong></h3>

<p>At the center of the Milky Way is a giant black hole, and for the first time ever,&nbsp;<a href="#">astronomers were able to see it</a>.</p>



<p>Black holes don&#8217;t have surfaces, like planets or stars. Instead, these mysterious cosmic objects have a boundary called an &#8220;event horizon,&#8221; a point of no return. If anything swoops too close to that point, it will fall inward, never to escape the hole&#8217;s gravity.</p>



<p>With the power of eight linked radio dishes from around the world, the&nbsp;<a href="#">Event Horizon Telescope took a picture</a>&nbsp;of the shadow of the supermassive black hole known as Sagittarius A*. Hundreds of scientists from 80 institutions around the globe worked together to collect, process, and piece together fragments of data to make the picture.</p>



<p>Up until three years ago, any depiction of a black hole was merely an artist&#8217;s interpretation or a computer model. Now scientists have a snapshot of the real deal, which spans 27 million miles.</p>



<p>With financial support from the National Science Foundation and other groups, scientists plan to enhance their technology to make the image drastically sharper.</p>
